# Hello!

So, certain social chat platforms have restrictions on what URLs are considered "trusted".

These restrictions appear to have been built from the perspective of preventing IP scraping.

Anything you see here is available at <https://github.com/20kdc/20kdc.github.io> under the Unlicense unless:

* Otherwise noted (check README and LICENSE files in containing directories)
* It's an asset brought in by GitHub's Jekyll pipeline (such as normalize.css)
